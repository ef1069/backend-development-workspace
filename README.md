# backend-development-workspace
Ethan Fulton

This repository will be my workspace for my Backend Development class. It will house all of my coursework along with my notes, references, and resources. I am hoping to track my goals and progress along the way to see how much I improve along with what I want and need to improve on.

I am hoping to learn more about backend development and what makes someone successful in this career. I am unsure what I want to pursue in the computer science field and am hoping my experience in this class will help me narrow down my view. I have no experience with SQL, REST APIs, and other database managment software and am excited to learn exactly what they do. 

I plan to use this repository to store my work and organize my progress and notes throughout the semester. In the end, it should be a organized space where I can review what I learned and carry these skills with me in the future.
